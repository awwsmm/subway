This repository uses [ubiquitous language](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/UbiquitousLanguage.html) to ensure that all relevant concepts are clear and distinct. To that end, this README defines the main _nouns_ in the repo (entities in the domain model), all of which are contained in this `model` module.
