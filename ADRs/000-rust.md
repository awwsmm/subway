Architectural Decision Record No. ADR-000

# Why Rust?

I chose Rust for this project because I want to get more experience building large projects in Rust. This project could just as easily have been built using any modern language, there is no real argument for building it in Rust over, e.g. TypeScript / Node.js, Java, etc.

My long-term vision for this project is that we will have a backend running in Rust and a frontend running in (probably) TypeScript / React. We _could_ write both the frontend and the backend in the same language (likely TypeScript) for maintainability, but I wanted to write the backend in Rust for my own education and practice.
